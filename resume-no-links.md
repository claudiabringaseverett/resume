### About me

Hi, I'm Kris. Back in 2007 I taught myself enough Ruby to automate parts of the job I had then. Since then I've worked in a variety of domains and technologies as a software engineer, site reliability engineer, and solutions architect as well as doing project management and product development.

### What I look for in a workplace

* Feedback-friendly culture with short feedback cycles
* A working environment where questions are seen as essential for knowledge transfer and growth
* Ability to use whatever tool is most suitable to solve a problem
* Access to a standing desk and a Linux workstation
* Relative quiet (loud, open floorplans packed with people aren't for me)
* A robust software engineering practice using some kind of project management tool (e.g. Pivotal Tracker) or the desire to do so
* "Agile" development process; basically any process that includes short iterations, frequent production releases and quick feedback rather than a waterfall process

### What I want to continue doing

* Be a multiplier for other engineers, internal and external
* Work on infrastructure-as-code and continuous integration/continuous deployment
* Development in Go
* Use agile methodologies to build software
* Interview stakeholders, discover problems, create solutions
* Deployments onto Kubernetes

### What I want to start doing

* Development in another language, possibly Rust
