## About me

Hi, I'm Kris. Back in 2007 I taught myself enough Ruby to automate parts of the job I had then. Since then I've worked in a variety of domains and technologies as a software engineer, site reliability engineer, and solutions architect as well as doing project management and product development.

### Past (reverse-chrono)

#### Staff Engineer at [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io/)
  * R&D on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org)
    * Led a revamp/refactoring of the Cloud Foundry CLI
    * On the Security Enablement team implemented a mechanism to scan all Cloud Foundry git repositories for secrets
    * Various work on [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh), [BOSH CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli), Diego
  * [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org)
    * Worked on many aspects; BOSH release, scheduler, CLI
  * Solutions Architect
    * Devised multiple solutions for Comcast in their transition to [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform)
    * Created documentation/mititgation for multiple network-related Pivotal Cloud Foundry CVEs
  * Customer[0]
    * Lead Engineer
    * Took over an internal project and made it into a viable customer-facing product, [pcf-pipelines](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines), which uses Terraform and Concourse to deploy Pivotal Cloud Foundry
    * Created [pg2mysql](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pg2mysql) to migrate PCF customers from PostgreSQL to MySQL, the third such attempt and the only one that worked
    * Brought in as a champion of PCF and knowledge expert regarding multiple aspects of PCF during pre-sales calls

#### Lead Developer at [DaisyBill](https://www.daisybill.com)
  * Lots of Ruby, SQL
  * Designed and implemented a new product to add a revenue stream

#### Consultant at [Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/labs)
  * Mostly Ruby/Rails websites as well as one iOS 5 app, one JRuby website

#### Consultant at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/)
  * All Ruby/Rails work
  * Part of a pair that led a rewrite of the core bidding algorithm for a large wholesale auto auction website

### Present

#### SWE-SRE at [LightStep](https://www.lightstep.com)

* Created robust build and release pipelines in Concourse
* Dockerfile updates to build Go binaries uniformly and quickly
* Created multiple developer tools for managing [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) certs, CI pipelines
* Extended existing developer CLI tools for managing deployments
* Created a system for recording upgrades of helm charts for tracking developer KPIs including time from code merge to deploy
* Led security-focused work to remove secrets from Git repositories, restrict secrets to least-privileged access
* Instrumental in transition to a monolithic Git repository
* Led conversion of existing infrastructure to Terraform, used Terraform for new infrastructure
* Lots of work with [helm](https://helm.sh) charts to standardize config

### Future

#### Continue

* Being a multiplier for other engineers
* Working on infrastructure-as-code and continuous integration/continuous deployment
* Development in Go
* Using agile methodologies to build software

#### Investigate

* Development in another language: Rust, Elixir, Elm

## What I look for in a workplace

* Feedback-friendly culture with short feedback cycles
* A working environment where questions are seen as essential for knowledge transfer and growth
* Ability to use whatever tool is most suitable to solve a problem
* Access to a standing desk and a Linux workstation
* Relative quiet (loud, open floorplans packed with people aren't for me)
* A robust software engineering practice using some kind of project management tool (e.g. Pivotal Tracker) or the desire to do so
* "Agile" development process; basically any process that includes short iterations, frequent production releases and quick feedback rather than a waterfall process
