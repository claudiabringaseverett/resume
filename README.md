## tl;dr

* 10 years of experience as a software engineer, originally self-taught
* Broad experience beyond software engineering (see below)
* Highly experienced with Ruby, Go, shell, SQL
* Currently a Staff Engineer at [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io/)
* Previously a consultant at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) and [Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/labs), Lead Developer at [DaisyBill](https://www.daisybill.com)
* Core contributor to [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org) (BOSH, Diego, CLI) and [Concourse](https://concourse.ci)
* Technical lead for multiple small- to medium-sized teams

## Experience

Distributed systems (BOSH, Diego), configuration and secrets management, containers (Docker, Garden), 12-factor/cloud native application transformation, build and release, continuous integration and deployment (Jenkins, GoCD, Concourse), testing, infrastructure-as-code (Terraform), pipelines-as-code, network, application, and physical security, agile transformation, product development, AWS, GCP, and vSphere, Git branching strategies, monitoring and alerting (DataDog, Sentry), and customer success.

## Selected History (reverse-chronological)

* Architect and primary engineer of [`pcf-pipelines`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines), a collection of CI pipelines-as-code for deploying and upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry
* Architect and sole engineer of [`pg2mysql`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pg2mysql), a fast and safe tool for migrating data from PostgreSQL to MySQL, and [`yaml-patch`](https://github.com/krishicks/yaml-patch), a complete re-implementation of [RFC6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) in YAML
* Numerous talks on best practices for CI/CD and Git
* Originated idea and implemented a [system](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/cred-alert/tree/master/src/cred-alert/revok) for scanning Git repositories for secrets, replacing an inadequate prior attempt
* Reigned in massive technical debt while technical lead of the Cloud Foundry CLI
* Created a new product and revenue stream at DaisyBill
* Wrote a parser for EDI ANSI X12 documents
* Implemented a stored procedure in PostgreSQL to reduce query of 1.2mm records from 80+ seconds to 300ms
* Led a major rewrite of an online bidding platform
* Developed an automation framework that drove IE6, resulting in a 75-100x improvement in speed and elimination of errors in a data entry system

## Interests

* Delivering business value first and foremost
* Solving problems with a pragmatic approach to testing and implementation
* Deep-dives into code to root out a bug or improve understanding of the code
* Building new systems, refactoring old ones
* Teaching people about Git, Vim, and Go
* Improving the interview process for software engineers
* Improving my ability and the ability of others to deliver software

## What I look for in a workplace

* Feedback-friendly culture with short feedback cycles
* A working environment where asking questions is seen as a good thing
* Ability to use whatever tool is most suitable to solve a problem
* Access to a standing desk and a Linux workstation
* Relative quiet (vast, loud, open floorplans packed with people aren't for me)
* A robust software engineering practice using some kind of project management tool (e.g. Pivotal Tracker) or the desire to do so
* "Agile" development process; basically any process that includes short iterations, frequent production releases and quick feedback rather than a waterfall process
