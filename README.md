## tl;dr

10 years of experience as a software engineer. I have experience and a
continuing interest in solving the sort of problems Golang is suitable for,
continuous integration/delivery, build and release, and product/project
management. I've done test-driven development and various flavors of agile
since 2009, including full-time pairing.

## Timeline

**2007 |** Started teaching myself software engineering with Ruby.

**2009 |** Joined ThoughtWorks as a consultant and gained VCS, TDD, CI, and pairing experience, in addition learning how to write well-designed software.

**2011 |** Joined Pivotal Labs where I did more consulting in the same spirit as at ThoughtWorks, and also gained PostgreSQL experience.

**2013 |** Joined DaisyBill, a startup, to take a break from consulting.

**2014 |** Joined Pivotal to work on Cloud Foundry, where I gained experience in Go, BOSH, Cloud Foundry, deployment ("build and release"), distributed systems, product and project management.

## Recent work

* [`yaml-patch`](https://github.com/krishicks/yaml-patch): a library for creating
RFC6902 ("JSON Patch") patches, but in YAML
* [`pg2mysql`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pg2mysql): a library for migrating
  data from PostgreSQL to MySQL
* [`pcf-pipelines`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines): a collection
  of Concourse pipelines for installing and upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry and
  its addons

## What makes me tick

* Delivering business value first and foremost
* Solving problems with a pragmatic approach to testing and implementation
* Deep-dives into code to root out a bug or improve understanding of the code
* Building new systems, refactoring old ones
* Teaching people about Git and Git workflows, Vim
* Improving the interview process for software engineers
* Improving my ability and the ability of others to deliver software

## What I look for in a workplace

* Feedback-friendly culture with short feedback cycles
* A working environment where asking questions is seen as a good thing
* Ability to use whatever tool is most suitable to solve a problem
* Standing desk (I've used standing desks exclusively since 2011)
* Relative quiet (vast, loud, open floorplans packed with people aren't for me)
* A robust software engineering practice using some kind of project management tool (e.g. Pivotal Tracker) or the desire to do so
* "Agile" development process; basically any process that includes short iterations, frequent production releases and quick feedback rather than a waterfall process
