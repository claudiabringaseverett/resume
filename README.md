## tl;dr

10 years of experience as a software engineer. I have experience and a
continuing interest in solving the sort of problems Go is suitable for,
continuous integration/delivery, build and release, and product/project
management. I've done test-driven development and various flavors of agile
since 2009, including full-time pairing.

## What makes me tick

* Delivering business value first and foremost
* Solving problems with a pragmatic approach to testing and implementation
* Deep-dives into code to root out a bug or improve understanding of the code
* Building new systems, refactoring old ones
* Teaching people about Git and Git workflows, Vim
* Improving the interview process for software engineers
* Improving my ability and the ability of others to deliver software

## What I look for in a workplace

* Feedback-friendly culture with short feedback cycles
* A working environment where asking questions is seen as a good thing
* Ability to use whatever tool is most suitable to solve a problem
* Standing desk (I've used standing desks exclusively since 2011)
* Relative quiet (vast, loud, open floorplans packed with people aren't for me)
* A robust software engineering practice using some kind of project management tool (e.g. Pivotal Tracker) or the desire to do so
* "Agile" development process; basically any process that includes short iterations, frequent production releases and quick feedback rather than a waterfall process

## Recent work

  data from PostgreSQL to MySQL
