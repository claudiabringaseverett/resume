# About Me

I started teaching myself programming in 2007, using VBA. I quickly switched to
learning Ruby, eventually getting a position as a consultant at ThoughtWorks,
where my career as a developer truly began. Since then I have worked as a
consultant at Pivotal Labs, and also as the CTO of DaisyBill, an early-stage
startup.

I care about quality code, quick and useful tests, being pragmatic and getting
things done. I am passionate about not just how the user will interact with a
product, but also the APIs the product interacts with, how the code that drives
the product is structured, and how the data backing the product is structured.

My hobbies include travel, photography, and reading.

# Skills

I have been a consultant for a number of years, and am comfortable with
TDD/BDD, pairing, and refactoring legacy code. My most recent experience is in
cloud infrastructure. I am an evangelist of Cloud Foundry, BOSH, and Concourse.
My preferred development environment is Vim on Linux.

I have recent experience with, and prefer to continue using:

* Git (since 2009)
* Go (since 2014)
* Vim (since 2011)
* PostgreSQL (since 2011)
* BOSH (since 2014)
* Cloud Foundry (since 2014)
* Concourse
* Linux

I am mostly ambivalent about, but have experience with:

* JavaScript (since 2009)
* Ruby (since 2007)
* Java (2014)
* Rails (2008-2014)
* iOS (2012, 1 app)

# Experience

### Senior Developer - Pivotal, 2014-

I rejoined Pivotal to work on open source projects, and to refresh my skills as
a consultant.

I have experience on the following teams and products, with thousands of
commits to my name:

* BOSH
* Diego
* CF CLI
* PCF Solutions
* Concourse

I first started writing Go on BOSH), as one of the initial authors of the Go
BOSH micro CLI (now [bosh-init](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-init)). I
continued writing Go on the Diego team during a major refactor for performance
prior to it becoming the default runtime for Cloud Foundry.

I was on-site at Comcast as a PCF Solutions Architect helping make a plan for
and implementing splitting of their Enterprise Services Platform into
microservices suitable for running on Cloud Foundry. This included pairing with
Comcast developers, teaching them TDD, Git, how to set up and use a CI/CD
pipeline, in addition to developing Cloud Foundry-based solutions to their
architecture concerns.

I authored [CVE-2016-0896](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2016-0896), the
associated [Knowledge
Base](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/223312627) article, and a
tool to help mitigate it, [ASG
Creator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/asg-creator).

I spent a month in Sydney helping bring a Fujitsu developer up to speed on Go,
TDD, and pairing while working on the CF CLI. I also led a major, multi-month
effort to refactor and modernize the CF CLI codebase. I am the owner of 160+
stories in the [CF CLI Pivotal
Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/892938) to that effect
(search for `owner:KH includedone:true`)

On the PCF Security Enablement team I built a more robust solution to the
problem of scanning GitHub repositories for credentials.

### Lead Developer, CTO - DaisyBill, 2013-2014

I joined DaisyBill to experience what it was like both to work at an
early-stage startup and to have a stronger voice in the development of the
productâ€“moreso than when I was a consultant. I had a large impact in driving
features from concept to planning to implementation, harnessing skills gained
over years of consulting. I single-handedly transformed the product, allowing
DaisyBill to both bring on new customers and better serve existing customers.

### Senior Consultant - Pivotal Labs, 2011-2013

* CaseCommons (casebook) - 8 months
* Sony (X-Factor USA) - 3 months
* IntentMedia (Exit Units) - 7 months
* Cabulous (Flywheel) - 7 months

I joined Pivotal Labs on moving to NYC. I worked on a variety of projects, from
large Rails projects with 25+ developers, to projects with a single developer.
I quickly learned and became effective in a previously unknown-to-me language
(Java) at Intent Media, where I was one of the main developers of their Exit
Unit product. I also directed Intent Media's Git workflow.

I also worked on an iOS app, my first foray into mobile, which was a great
success for the client and a fantastic learning experience for me.
  
While at Pivotal I took on a role where I was available for Git consulting for
clients of Pivotal, in addition to giving a talk to a Pivotal Labs Tech Talks
audience in 2012 on Git.

### Consultant, Senior Consultant - ThoughtWorks, 2009-2011

* Manheim (OVE.com) - 17 months
* Hearst (Prime-A-Pump) - 3 months
* Bloomberg (BGOV.com) - 3 months

I joined ThoughtWorks when I decided I wanted to become a better developer and
would learn best on a team with skilled developers, rather than work alone.
This was my first foray into Rails, TDD, pair-programming, and working on a
team larger than one.

My time at ThoughtWorks was instrumental in shaping my resulting career as a
developer. At Manheim I worked on OVE.com, a sort of eBay for wholesale cars. I
was a lead developer on an 8-month rewrite of the core of the business, the
bidding system. The result was greatly improved performance and user experience
which allowed the business to grow beyond a plateau it had reached.

At Hearst I was part of a small team that developed a site which ended up not
going into production. However, it was a good learning experience to be on a
team without an established workflow or product.
    
At Bloomberg I was part of a large team that developed BGOV.com, Bloomberg's
government news site. I did a fair amount of front-end work, but also
contributed to the system that pulled up news articles from the Terminal and
configured them for display on BGOV.

### Temp, Junior Developer - First American Title, 2006-2008

* Bespoke automation framework

This is where I began my journey to become a software developer. I was
initially hired as a temp doing data entry. Through a series of fortunate
events my efforts to improve my job were noted and I was given opportunities to
work on some basic automation software. The software ended up not delivering as
they'd hoped due to a small feature-set and no extensibility. However, I was
inspired to teach myself programming and develop my own solution. The solution
was an automation framework built on top of a testing framework, WATIR, which
was used to automate the browser. It was Ruby on Windows, packaged in a
self-extracting executable. It was deployed to production and used to greatly
reduce the cost of and increase the speed and accuracy of data entry.
