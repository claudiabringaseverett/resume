#### About Me

I started teaching myself programming in 2007, using VBA. I quickly switched to learning Ruby, eventually getting a position as a consultant at ThoughtWorks, where my career as a developer truly began. Since then I have worked as a consultant at Pivotal Labs, and also as the CTO of DaisyBill, an early-stage startup.

I care about quality code, quick and useful tests, being pragmatic and getting things done. I am passionate about not just how the user will interact with the front-end, but also the APIs the front-end interacts with, how the code that drives those APIs is structured, and how the data itself is structured.

My hobbies include travel, photography, and reading.

#### Experience

##### Senior Developer (Contractor) - Pivotal, 2014-2015

I contracted with Pivotal to work on CloudFoundry. I wanted to work on an open source project for once, and ended up working on multiple. I worked on [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) and [Diego](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release), and had a hand in the many submodules that make up each project. The BOSH work was mainly fixing bugs, updating stemcells and the code that builds them, adding support for IaaS-specific features and expanding support for IaaS-agnostic features. I was a member of Diego during a major refactoring necessary prior to going to production.

##### Lead Developer, CTO - DaisyBill, 2013-2014

I joined DaisyBill to experience what it was like both to work at an early-stage startup and to have a stronger voice in the development of the productâ€“moreso than when I was a consultant. I had a large impact in driving features from concept to planning to implementation, harnessing skills gained over years of consulting. I single-handedly transformed the product, allowing DaisyBill to both bring on new customers and better serve existing customers.

##### Senior Consultant - Pivotal Labs, 2011-2013

* CaseCommons (casebook) - 8 months
* Sony (X-Factor USA) - 3 months
* IntentMedia (Exit Units) - 7 months
* Cabulous (Flywheel) - 7 months

I joined Pivotal Labs on moving to NYC. I worked on a variety of projects, from large Rails projects with 25+ developers, to projects with a single developer. I quickly learned and became effective in a previously unknown-to-me language (Java) at Intent Media, where I was one of the main developers of their Exit Unit product. I also directed Intent Media's Git workflow.

I also worked on an iOS app, my first foray into mobile, which was a great success for the client and a fantastic learning experience for me.
  
While at Pivotal I took on a role where I was available for Git consulting for clients of Pivotal, in addition to giving a talk to a Pivotal Labs Tech Talks audience in 2012 on Git.

##### Consultant, Senior Consultant - ThoughtWorks, 2009-2011

* Manheim (OVE.com) - 17 months
* Hearst (Prime-A-Pump) - 3 months
* Bloomberg (BGOV.com) - 3 months

I joined ThoughtWorks when I decided I wanted to become a better developer and would learn best on a team with skilled developers, rather than work alone. This was my first foray into Rails, TDD, pair-programming, and working on a team larger than one.

My time at ThoughtWorks was instrumental in shaping my resulting career as a developer. At Manheim I worked on OVE.com, a sort of eBay for wholesale cars. I was a lead developer on an 8-month rewrite of the core of the business, the bidding system. The result was greatly improved performance and user experience which allowed the business to grow beyond a plateau it had reached.

At Hearst I was part of a small team that developed a site which ended up not going into production. However, it was a good learning experience to be on a team without an established workflow or product.
    
At Bloomberg I was part of a large team that developed BGOV.com, Bloomberg's government news site. I did a fair amount of front-end work, but also contributed to the system that pulled up news articles from the Terminal and configured them for display on BGOV.

##### Temp, Junior Developer - First American Title, 2006-2008
* Bespoke automation framework

This is where I began my journey to become a software developer. I was initially hired as a temp doing data entry. Through a series of fortunate events my efforts to improve my job were noted and I was given opportunities to work on some basic automation software. The software ended up not delivering as they'd hoped due to a small feature-set and no extensibility. However, I was inspired to teach myself programming and develop my own solution. The solution was an automation framework built on top of a testing framework, WATIR, which was used to automate the browser. It was Ruby on Windows, packaged in a self-extracting executable. It was deployed to production and used to greatly reduce the cost of and increase the speed and accuracy of data entry.
